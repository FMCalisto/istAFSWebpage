## Web Pages

DSI offers a Web page hosting service.

The media is done using the [central storage system AFS](http://dsi.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/servicos/armazenamento-e-backup/armazenamento-afs/), so you can be configured from any client computer with AFS installed or through [Sigma cluster](http://dsi.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/servicos/servidores-e-dados/unix-shell/). 

This service can be used by:

>
* All [IST users](http://dsi.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/servicos/servidores-e-dados/paginas-web/utilizadores-ist/);
* IST [Central Unity](http://dsi.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/servicos/servidores-e-dados/paginas-web/utilizadores-ist/), requiring institutional pages;
* [Academic Institutions](http://dsi.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/servicos/servidores-e-dados/paginas-web/entidades/), associations and other non-institutional organizations with ties to the IST.

## Storage (AFS)

DSI offers the IST community data storage service based on AFS (Andrew File System) technology.

AFS is a distributed file system that users can use simultaneously and that runs on different machines.

## Access to AFS

It is possible to access IST AFS:

through a remote client according to the users preference and the operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, etc..);
by Sigma which also runs with a remote AFS client so that users can keep their data stored.
For users and groups by default is set a quota of 300 megabytes.
